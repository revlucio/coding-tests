There are two bugs in this web application. Please find them and fix them.

What's supposed to happen:
==========================

/Home/Index (the default view) will ask you your name.

When you enter your name and press "Go", the application will display /Home/Welcome

This view should welcome you by name, and tell you the current date, in the format "January 4, 1987"

What to do:
===========

Identify the two bugs. Determine whether they are currently covered by failing tests or not.

If a bug IS currently covered by a failing test, then fix the code.

If the bug is NOT currently covered by a failing test, then 

1. Write a new test that reproduces the bug
2. Modify the code so that your new test passes.

DO NOT MODIFY ANY EXISTING TESTS.
